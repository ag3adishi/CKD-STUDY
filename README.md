# CKD-STUDY
# 🩺 Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) Risk Factor Analysis

This project presents a detailed statistical study on Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) based on real-world medical data. It investigates various risk factors associated with CKD and their statistical significance using chi-square tests, regression analysis, and correlation methods.

## 📊 Dataset Information

- 📂 **Source:** UCI Machine Learning Repository  
- 🔗 [Chronic Kidney Disease Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/chronic_kidney_disease)
- 📈 Total patients analyzed: 235  
- 👥 Age group: 21 to 90 years  
- 🧪 Variables: Age, Anemia, Diabetes Mellitus, Hypertension, CAD, Albumin, Serum Creatinine, Hemoglobin, RBC count, Sodium, Potassium, Blood Urea

---

## 🧪 Methodology

- Data cleaning and variable selection
- Chi-square test for association between risk factors and CKD
- Correlation and regression analysis between key clinical indicators
- Data visualization using scatter plots and tables
- Tools used: **R**, **Excel**

---

## 🧠 Hypotheses Tested

1. Association between age and CKD
2. Age and CAD
3. Age and Hypertension
4. CAD and CKD
5. Diabetes Mellitus and CKD
6. Anemia and CKD

➡️ **Result:** All null hypotheses were rejected, indicating strong statistical associations between these risk factors and CKD.

---

## 🔍 Key Findings

- CKD is significantly associated with **age, diabetes, hypertension, CAD, and anemia**
- **Red Blood Cell count** and **Hemoglobin** show a strong positive correlation
- **Serum Creatinine** has moderate correlation with **Blood Urea**
- **Sodium and Potassium** show a weak negative correlation
- Regression models helped quantify relationships between variables

| Variables                     | Correlation | Relationship        |
|------------------------------|-------------|---------------------|
| Hemoglobin & RBC Count       | +0.70       | Strong Positive     |
| Blood Urea & Serum Creatinine| +0.50       | Moderate Positive   |
| Sodium & Potassium           | -0.30       | Weak Negative       |
| Albumin & Serum Creatinine   | +0.30       | Weak Positive       |
